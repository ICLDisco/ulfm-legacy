===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of ULFM since the inception
of the project.

As more fully described in the "Software Version Number" section in
the README file, Open MPI typically releases two separate version
series simultaneously.  Since these series have different goals and
are semi-independent of each other, a single NEWS-worthy item may be
introduced into different series at different times.  For example,
feature F was introduced in the vA.B series at version vA.B.C, and was
later introduced into the vX.Y series at vX.Y.Z.

The first time feature F is released, the item will be listed in the
vA.B.C section, denoted as:

   (** also to appear: X.Y.Z) -- indicating that this item is also
                                 likely to be included in future release
                                 version vX.Y.Z.

When vX.Y.Z is later released, the same NEWS-worthy item will also be
included in the vX.Y.Z section and be denoted as:

   (** also appeared: A.B.C)  -- indicating that this item was previously
                                 included in release version vA.B.C.

Release 1.1
-----------
Focus has been toward improving stability, feature coverage for intercomms, and following
the updated specification for MPI_ERR_PROC_FAILED_PENDING.
- Addition of the MPI_ERR_PROC_FAILED_PENDING error code, as per newer specification revision. Properly returned from point-to-point, non-blocking ANY_SOURCE operations.
- Alias MPI_ERR_PROC_FAILED, MPI_ERR_PROC_FAILED_PENDING and MPI_ERR_REVOKED to the corresponding standard blessed -extension- names MPIX_ERR_xxx.
- Support for Intercommunicators:
 - Support for the blocking version of the agreement, MPI_COMM_AGREE on Intercommunicators.
 - MPI_COMM_REVOKE tested on intercommunicators.
- Disabled completely (.ompi_ignore) many untested components.
- Bugfixes:
 - SendRecv would not always report MPI_ERR_PROC_FAILED correctly.
 - SendRecv could incorrectly update the status with errors pertaining to the Send portion of the Sendrecv.
 - Revoked send operations are now always completed or remote cancelled and may not deadlock anymore.
 - Cancelled send operations to a dead peer will not trigger an assert when the BTL reports that same failure.
 - Repeat calls to operations returning MPI_ERR_PROC_FAILED will eventually return MPI_ERR_REVOKED when another process revokes the communicator.

Release 1.0
-----------

Focus has been toward improving performance, both before and after the occurence of failures. The list of new features includes:
- Support for the non-blocking version of the agreement, MPI_COMM_IAGREE.
- Compliance with the latest ULFM specification draft. In particular, the MPI_COMM_(I)AGREE semantic has changed.
- New algorithm to perform agreements, with a truly logarithmic complexity in number of ranks, which translates into huge performance boosts in MPI_COMM_(I)AGREE and MPI_COMM_SHRINK.
- New algorithm to perform communicator revocation. MPI_COMM_REVOKE performs a reliable broadcast with a fixed maximum output degree, which scales logarithmically with the number of ranks.
- Improved support for our traditional network layer:
 - TCP: fully tested
 - SM: fully tested (with the exception of XPMEM, which remains unsupported)
- Added support for High Performance networks
 - Open IB: reasonably tested
 - uGNI: reasonably tested
- The tuned collective module is now enabled by default (reasonably tested), expect a huge performance boost compared to the former basic default setting<
 - Back-ported PBS/ALPS fixes from Open MPI
 - Back-ported OpenIB bug/performance fixes from Open MPI
 - Improve Context ID allocation algorithm to reduce overheads of Shrink
 - Miscellaneous bug fixes
